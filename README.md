-This repository contains a new path planner method for robot navigation. 
-The path planner is based on a particular kind of mathematical curves, called NURBS curves.
-The work was done for my master's thesis in Thales Alenia Space.
-The C++ code is not optimized, the thesis's goal was to prove that a path planner with NURBS could 
 be possible.
